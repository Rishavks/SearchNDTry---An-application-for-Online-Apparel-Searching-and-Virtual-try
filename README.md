# SearchNDTry---An-application-for-Online-Apparel-Searching-and-Virtual-try
SearchNDtry is an image based search and try-on application with web and mobile interface both; wherein the user can look-up visually similar apparels online and try-on apparels virtually.  
The search feature is implemented with the help of Google Vision Api, which takes an input query image from the user and returns a list of visually similar images available on online e-commerce websites. 
The virtual try feature is implemented using deep learning models and image processing, which extracts the 2D cloth from a selected image and wraps it on the user image to provide a preview before purchasing.
